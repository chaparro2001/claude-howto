# Ejemplos de Checkpoints

Ejemplos del mundo real sobre el uso efectivo de checkpoints en Claude Code.

Nota: Los checkpoints se crean automaticamente con cada prompt de usuario. No necesitas guardarlos manualmente. Para hacer rewind, presiona `Esc` dos veces (`Esc+Esc`) o usa `/rewind` para abrir el navegador de checkpoints.

## Ejemplo 1: Migracion de base de datos

### Escenario
Necesitas migrar de MySQL a PostgreSQL pero queres explorar tanto una migracion directa como un enfoque gradual de escritura dual.

### Workflow

```
User: Let's implement a direct migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL
      [Checkpoint A created automatically]

Claude: I'll implement the direct migration...
[Changes database driver, updates queries, modifies schema]

User: Run the tests
      [Checkpoint B created automatically]

Claude: Running tests...
❌ 15 tests failing - connection pool issues

User: This approach has issues. Let's try the dual-write pattern instead.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects Checkpoint A, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Now implement a dual-write pattern where we write to both databases

Claude: I'll implement dual-write migration...
[Implements dual-write layer, gradual migration strategy]

User: Run the tests

Claude: Running tests...
✅ All tests passing

User: The dual-write approach is clearly safer. Let's commit this.
```

## Ejemplo 2: Optimizacion de rendimiento

### Escenario
Multiples estrategias de optimizacion de rendimiento para probar.

### Workflow

```
User: Let's optimize the API response time. Current: 450ms
      [Checkpoint "Baseline" created automatically]

Claude: I'll add database query caching...
[Implements Redis caching]

User: Run performance tests

Claude: Results: 280ms average response time (38% improvement)

User: Let me try a different approach.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Baseline" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Try database query optimization instead

Claude: I'll optimize database queries...
[Adds indexes, optimizes N+1 queries]

User: Run performance tests

User: Let me also try a third approach.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Baseline" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Try response compression and CDN

Claude: I'll add compression and CDN...
[Implements gzip, sets up CDN]

User: Run performance tests

Claude: Results: 320ms average response time (29% improvement)

User: Query optimization was the best. Let me go back and combine it with caching.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects the checkpoint after query optimization, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Now add Redis caching on top of these optimized queries

Claude: [Adds Redis caching on top of optimized queries]

User: Run performance tests

Claude: Results: 95ms average response time (79% improvement) 🎉

User: Perfect! This is the winner. Let's commit this.

## Ejemplo 3: Iteracion de UI/UX

### Escenario
Probar diferentes layouts para un dashboard.

### Workflow

```
User: Let's redesign the dashboard with a sidebar layout
      [Checkpoint "Start" created automatically]

Claude: [Implements sidebar layout]

User: Show me a screenshot

Claude: [Shows screenshot]

User: The sidebar feels cramped. Let's try a top navigation instead.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Start" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Try a top navigation layout

Claude: [Implements top navigation]

User: Show me a screenshot

Claude: [Shows screenshot]

User: Better, but let's try a card-based grid layout
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Start" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Try a card-based grid layout

Claude: [Implements card grid]

User: Show me a screenshot

Claude: [Shows screenshot]

User: This is great! But can we combine the top nav with the card grid?
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects the checkpoint after the card grid, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Add top navigation to the card grid layout

Claude: [Adds top navigation to card grid]

User: Perfect! This is the final design.
```

## Ejemplo 4: Sesion de depuracion

### Escenario
Rastrear un bug complicado con multiples hipotesis.

### Workflow

```
User: There's a memory leak in the application
      [Checkpoint "Before debugging" created automatically]

Claude: Let me investigate...
[Analyzes code]

User: I think it's in the event listeners. Let's fix those.

Claude: [Fixes event listener cleanup]

User: Run memory profiler

Claude: Still leaking memory - event listeners weren't the issue

User: Let me go back and try a different hypothesis.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Before debugging" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Maybe it's the database connections?

Claude: [Implements connection pooling fixes]

User: Run memory profiler

Claude: Still leaking - not the connections either

User: Let me go back and try another angle.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Before debugging" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Let's check for circular references

Claude: [Finds and fixes circular references in cache]

User: Run memory profiler

Claude: ✅ Memory leak fixed! The circular references in the caching layer were the culprit.

User: Excellent! Let's commit this fix.
```

## Ejemplo 5: Evolucion del diseno de API

### Escenario
Disenar una REST API con multiples iteraciones.

### Workflow

```
User: Create a REST API for our blog platform
      [Checkpoint "Before API design" created automatically]

Claude: [Creates basic CRUD API]

User: This is too simple. Let's add pagination and filtering

Claude: [Adds pagination and filtering]

User: We need better resource relationships

Claude: [Implements HATEOAS links]

User: Actually, let's try GraphQL instead of REST
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects "Before API design" checkpoint, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Implement a GraphQL API for our blog platform instead

Claude: [Implements GraphQL API]

User: I think REST is better for our use case.
[User presses Esc+Esc, selects the checkpoint after HATEOAS, chooses "Restore code and conversation"]

User: Let's finalize the REST approach.
```

## Ejemplo 6: Gestion de configuracion

User: The tests are too slow. Let's optimize.

Claude: [Optimizes test setup, adds parallel execution]

User: Run tests

Claude: 89 tests passing, 92% coverage, 35 seconds ✅

User: Great! Now add E2E tests for critical paths

Claude: [Adds Playwright E2E tests]

User: Run all tests

Claude: 112 tests passing, 94% coverage, 2 minutes

User: Perfect balance of coverage and speed!
```

## Ejemplo 8: Usar Summarize from Checkpoint

### Escenario
Despues de una larga sesion de depuracion, queres condensar la conversacion preservando el contexto.

### Workflow

```
User: [After 20+ messages of debugging and exploration]

[User presses Esc+Esc, selects an early checkpoint, chooses "Summarize from here"]
[Optionally provides instructions: "Focus on what we tried and what worked"]

Claude: [Generates a summary of the conversation from that point forward]
[Original messages are preserved in the transcript]
[The summary replaces the visible conversation, reducing context window usage]

User: Now let's continue with the approach that worked.
```
